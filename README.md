# Builder Design Pattern Example

This is a C# example demonstrating the Builder design pattern in a real-world context. The example showcases how the Builder pattern can be used to construct complex objects step by step while separating the construction process from the representation.

## Overview

- **Program.cs:** This file contains the entry point for the application. It demonstrates the use of the Builder pattern to construct and display different types of vehicles.

- **Shop.cs:** The `Shop` class represents the Director, responsible for orchestrating the construction process. It defines the order and sequence of steps to build a vehicle.

- **VehicleBuilder.cs:** This abstract class defines the interface for vehicle builders. It includes abstract methods for building different parts of the vehicle, such as the frame, engine, wheels, and doors.

- **MotorCycleBuilder.cs, CarBuilder.cs, ScooterBuilder.cs:** These are concrete builder classes that extend `VehicleBuilder`. Each builder specializes in constructing a particular type of vehicle (Motorcycle, Car, or Scooter) and provides specific implementations for building the vehicle's components.

- **Vehicle.cs:** The `Vehicle` class is the product being constructed. It includes a dictionary to store vehicle parts and displays the assembled vehicle's details.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Compile and run the C# program.

3. Observe how the Builder pattern is used to create different types of vehicles step by step while keeping the construction process independent of the client code.

## Purpose

The Builder pattern is particularly useful when you need to create complex objects with many optional components. It allows you to construct objects with different configurations while maintaining a clear separation between the construction logic and the final product.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own use cases to understand how the Builder pattern can be applied in software development.
